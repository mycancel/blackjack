## Description

This project is a stepping stone in a personal goal to create a card game. Therefore, using the MERN stack, this blackjack game allows users to have a hand of two cards, to view their cards, and recieve new cards when requested. It follows the rules of blackjack, but it does not include any gambling elements. Rounds can be won by having a hand with a value closest to 21 without going over 21. The dealer also has a hand that the user cannot see that impacts the win condition of the user if they are closer to 21.
